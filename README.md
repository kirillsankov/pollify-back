## Project Description

Pollify is a modern web application for creating and conducting polls with AI-powered features. The project is developed using a cutting-edge technology stack and follows best development practices. Users can register, create polls with AI assistance, vote, and view detailed analytics with real-time insights.

**üöÄ Live Application**: [https://polls-ai.ru/](https://polls-ai.ru/)

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **NestJS** - a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. Used as the foundation for the entire backend, providing a modular architecture and adherence to SOLID principles.

- **TypeScript** - a typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript. Provides static typing, which helps avoid errors during development.

- **MongoDB** - a NoSQL database used to store data about users, polls, and votes. Chosen for its schema flexibility and good scalability.

- **Mongoose** - an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Provides a convenient way to model data and interact with the database.

### Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - used for secure user authentication and protection of API endpoints.

- **Passport** - middleware for authentication in Node.js. Integrated with NestJS to provide various authentication strategies.

- **bcrypt** - a library for password hashing, ensuring secure storage of user credentials.

### Queues and Background Tasks

- **BullMQ** - a library for managing task queues in Node.js. Used for processing asynchronous operations such as sending emails and processing poll results.

- **Redis** - an in-memory data store used by BullMQ for managing task queues.

- **@nestjs/schedule** - a module for scheduling tasks in NestJS, used for periodic operations such as cleaning up outdated data.

### Email Sending

- **Nodemailer** - a module for sending emails from Node.js applications. Used to send registration confirmation and password reset emails.

- **Handlebars** - a templating engine for creating HTML email templates.

### Artificial Intelligence

- **Google Gemini AI** - Google's artificial intelligence API used for analyzing poll results and generating insights.

### Data Validation and Transformation

- **class-validator** - a library for validating incoming data based on decorators.

- **class-transformer** - a library for transforming plain objects into class instances and vice versa.

### Development and Deployment

- **Docker** - containerization platform for consistent deployment across environments.

- **ESLint** - static code analysis tool for identifying and fixing code quality issues.

- **Prettier** - code formatter for maintaining consistent code style across the project.

## Installation and Running

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Redis (Bull MQ)

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```


### Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode
$ npm run start:dev

# Debug mode
$ npm run start:debug

# Production mode
$ npm run build
$ npm run start:prod
